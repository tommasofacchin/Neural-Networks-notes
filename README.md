# Machine Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on Machine Learning, organized into different topics and stored in markdown notebook files. These notes are a work in progress and will be updated as I continue studying and learning new concepts.

> **Note:** These notes are intended for personal learning and reference. They may contain errors or incomplete sections.

## **Mathematical Background**

To fully understand these notes, a solid grasp of the following mathematical and statistical concepts is recommended:

### 1. Linear Algebra
- Vectors, matrices, and operations (addition, multiplication)
- Dot product, cross product
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Matrix decomposition (SVD, LU)

### 2. Calculus
- Derivatives and gradients
- Partial derivatives
- Chain rule
- Gradient descent and optimization basics

### 3. Probability and Statistics
- Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)
- Expectation, variance, covariance
- Conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem
- Sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing

### 4. Additional Concepts
- Logarithms and exponentials
- Norms (L1, L2)
- Basic combinatorics (for probabilistic reasoning)

> These concepts are not explained in the notes.

## **How to Use These Notes**

- Each Markdown file is self-contained and can be read independently.
- These notebooks are also available on my kaggle profile.
- These notes are personal and intended as a study guide for ML concepts.  
- They are a work in progress and will be updated as I continue learning.
